<!--
Here we present a treeview (possibly filtered) of Sample Templates grouped e.g. by Type
Each leaf node will have a link to the sample
We need the ability to have a very long description, 
and perhaps on click or hover, allow the user to preview the entire sample in a tooltip or temporary editor
